# Captain Murphy's

**A themed home office & bar build — documented from concept to completion.**

## About

Captain Murphy's is a personal project to design and build a sci-fi themed home office and bar space. What started as a room planning exercise became something bigger — the process of imagining who would actually live in a space like this, and *why* someone would put a tiki bar in a place like this, eventually became the seed for the novel [*The First Tiki Bar on the Moon*](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DRMHV8LT).

The space draws heavily from 1970s–80s science fiction — the industrial utilitarian look of the USCSS Nostromo (*Alien*), the lo-fi space station vibe of Sevastopol Station (*Alien: Isolation*), and the warm amber glow of a tiki bar that has no business being where it is. If you've read the book, you'll recognize this as something close to Jack Simpson's lunar hab.

## What's in this repo

## The vision

A workspace that feels like you're stationed on a deep-space commercial towing vessel — but with better coffee and a liquor shelf. Modular white storage panels, pegboard equipment racks, institutional mugs on a rail, and warm accent lighting cutting through the cold utility of it all.

Half office. Half bar. The project that asked the question — and the book that tried to answer it.
