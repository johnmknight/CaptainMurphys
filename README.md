# Captain Murphy's

**A themed home office, workshop & hidden tiki bar build — documented from concept to completion.**

## About

Captain Murphy's is a personal project to design and build a sci-fi themed home office, workshop, and hidden tiki bar. What started as a room planning exercise became something bigger — the process of imagining who would actually live in a space like this, and *why* someone would put a tiki bar in a place like this, eventually became the seed for the novel [*The First Tiki Bar on the Moon*](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DRMHV8LT).

The space draws from grounded, hard sci-fi — not a starship, but a lunar base. The kind of place people actually *live* in. Design influences include *Moon* (2009), *For All Mankind*, *Interstellar*, and *Alien: Isolation*. Think lunar colony habitat module: functional white panels, industrial storage systems, equipment racks on the walls, and the warm amber glow of a hidden tiki bar that has no business being where it is. If you've read the book, you'll recognize this as something close to Jack Simpson's lunar hab.

## What's in this repo

This repository serves as a build log, design reference library, and planning tool for the project. Contents include:

## The vision

A workspace and workshop that feels like a habitat module on a lunar colony — but with better coffee and a hidden liquor shelf behind a panel that definitely isn't on the floor plan. Modular white storage panels, pegboard equipment racks, institutional mugs on a rail, and warm accent lighting cutting through the cold utility of it all.

Half office. Half workshop. Secret tiki bar. The project that asked the question — and the book that tried to answer it.
