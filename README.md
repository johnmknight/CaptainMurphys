# Captain Murphy's

**A themed home office & bar build — documented from concept to completion.**

## About

Captain Murphy's is a personal project to design and build a sci-fi themed home office and bar space. The name is a nod to *Sealab 2021* and the spirit of building something ridiculous with total commitment.

The aesthetic pulls from 1970s–80s science fiction — the industrial utilitarian look of the USCSS Nostromo (*Alien*), the lo-fi space station vibe of Sevastopol Station (*Alien: Isolation*), and the warm amber glow of a well-stocked tiki bar in orbit. Think: if Weyland-Yutani built a breakroom that doubled as a dive bar.

## What's in this repo

This repository serves as a build log, design reference library, and planning tool for the project. Contents include:

- **Product research & sourcing** — curated guides mapping real-world products to the target aesthetic
- **Design references** — mood boards, concept art analysis, and material studies
- **3D room planning** — layout iterations and spatial planning (Three.js)
- **Build documentation** — progress photos, material lists, and lessons learned

## Current files

## Tech stack

- **Frontend:** Vanilla JS, Three.js, HTML/CSS
- **Backend:** FastAPI, SQLite
- **Local dev:** Port 8081

## The vision

A workspace that feels like you're stationed on a deep-space commercial towing vessel — but with better coffee and a liquor shelf. Modular white storage panels, pegboard equipment racks, institutional mugs on a rail, and warm accent lighting cutting through the cold utility of it all.

Half office. Half bar. Fully committed to the bit.
